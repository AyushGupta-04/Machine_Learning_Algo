# Machine_Learning_Algo
A repo for testing of different ML models (Algorithms) &amp; plotting accuracy plots on Titanic_Survival Dataset.This project explores the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using different machine learning models. The aim is to compare how various algorithms perform on the same dataset and analyze their strengths and weaknesses.
