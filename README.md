A repository for testing different machine learning models and plotting accuracy plots using the Titanic Survival dataset.  This project compares the performance of various algorithms on the same dataset to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. üö¢


## Description

This project uses the well-known Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival.  Several machine learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated, with accuracy plots generated to visually compare their performance. The goal is to provide a clear demonstration of different model capabilities and aid in understanding their suitability for various classification tasks.


## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Jupyter Notebook:**  Used for code execution and documentation.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical computation.
* **Scikit-learn (sklearn):** For machine learning algorithms.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating accuracy plots.


## Installation Instructions ‚¨áÔ∏è

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AyushGupta-04/Machine_Learning_Algo.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Machine_Learning_Algo
   ```
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  # Create virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate (Linux/macOS) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
   ```
4. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```
   *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file should be created listing the necessary packages.  If one doesn't exist, create it manually listing `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.)*


## Usage Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Activate the virtual environment (if created).
2. Open `Project1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Execute the notebook cells sequentially.  The notebook contains detailed explanations and visualizations of the model training and evaluation process.
